Lots of love to the guys here who already documented quite a bit of the PS2 save format:

Do note you need DECRYPTED saves, made available using the CFW plugin SGDeemer. Saves from an unmodified PSP will not work. I'm planning to add encryption/decryption code later, but for now you'll have to do it yourself.

USAGE
Really only disassembles through script/console for now, use this as a starting point:
s = Save.new.disassemble
s.header
s.characters
s.characters.first
s.characters.first.items
s.characters.first.items.first
