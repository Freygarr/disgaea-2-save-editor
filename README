Lots of love to the guys here who already documented quite a bit of the PS2 save format:

Do note you need DECRYPTED saves, made available using the CFW plugin SGDeemer. Saves from an unmodified PSP will not work. I'm planning to add encryption/decryption code later, but for now you'll have to do it yourself.


Developer/hacker info follows

USAGE
Really only disassembles through script/console for now, use this as a starting point:
s = Save.new.disassemble
s.header
s.characters
s.characters.first
s.characters.first.items
s.characters.first.items.first

REVERSE ENGINEERING
Includes a useful comparison class for comparing unknown blocks of structures.
Example, comparing the first 5 character's unknown04 blocks, displaying them as int16s

characters = Save.new.disassemble.characters
compare = Compare.new(*characters[0...5])
compare.map = [:unknown04,:as_int16]
compare.compare_string

Gives output like the following:

0	2048	1536	0	3072	2304
1	3604	3602	0	2060	3341
2	1552	2318	0	3598	2317
3	778	  4108	0	1539	3337
4	2048	1536	0	3072	2304
5	3604	3602	0	2060	3341
6	1552	2318	0	3598	2317
7	778	  4108	0	1539	3337
